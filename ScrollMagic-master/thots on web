RG WEB APP:
	horizontal scrolling - single page:
			~9 panes on horizontal axis

			menu = 1 panes (save+help+user_info) (half pane on web?)

			{RAPGOD Title} (90 deg rotated) = 1/3 pane width


			text box  = 1 pane {we'll give you our textbox code - ???}
			- [panes snap to available screen size - note that on iOS the keyboard does not reduce screen height - trick may be to open on cursor]
				+ GENerate button {calls to seconbrain_server}
				+ RHYme button {calls to seconbrain_server}
				+ undo button (unlimited undoes would be dopppppppe)

			verse heat index = meter that shows number returned from secondbrain_serv after each new line - uses a color gradient in some {svg container - or maybe RAPGOD title}

			brain box = 1 pane (half pane on web?) - contains a bunch of svgs linked to model+/-pos_thots/neg_thots + should be called from some json lib pointing to all the files, models, pos_thots/neg_thots
			
			save pane = local+cloud save

			user info = 1 panes (username - location - description - subscription)
				+  {user agreement} pop up

			help info = 1 pane - {some text} and option to bring refresh help context

			contact us = {links and such}

	Constand 2px shaded screen border, does not move when pannels move - think Blinky <the free osx app>
